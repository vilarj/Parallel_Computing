Describe the algorithm that you used to solve the problem.
Include your final Mandelbrot set image.

Time your application (excluding the saving of your final JPG image) and create a strong scaling plot.
(Strong scaling concerns the speedup for a fixed problem size with respect to the number of processors). Use 2 to 12 OpenMP threads per node and vary the number of nodes to create the plot.
There is no need to use TAU profiling
